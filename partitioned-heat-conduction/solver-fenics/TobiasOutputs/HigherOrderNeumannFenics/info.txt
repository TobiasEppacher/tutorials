This folder contains simulation data with different temporal degrees (linear, quadratic, cubic)
as well as different waveform degrees (coupling)

The simulations were conducted with the following manufactured solution:

1 + x^2 + alpha * y^2 + beta * t^temporal_deg

Other information about simulation:

- pySDC dt always corresponded to the preCICE time-window-size (if not specified otherwise)
- Waveform degree 1 used Quasi-Newton acceleration, higher degrees don't as it is not allowed by preCICE
- As Neumann participant, Niklas Vinnitchenko's implementation in 'heatHigherOrder.py' with GaussLegendre(2) (order 4 time integrator) was used.
